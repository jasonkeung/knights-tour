# Knight's Tour GUI

This is a Java desktop application that demonstrates the Knight's Tour problem in chess, where the knight piece visits each square of the chessboard exactly once. The user is able to see the knight piece progress through its tour and is able to control its moves per second via GUI.

## Getting Started

Run KnightsTour.jar as an executable Java program to start; no other files are required. If on a Linux machine, make sure Right Click > Properties > Permissions > "Allow executing file as a program" is checked. The other files in the repository are for development purposes and are not needed for normal use of the program.

## Built With
